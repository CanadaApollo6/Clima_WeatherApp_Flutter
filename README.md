# Clima Weather App Flutter
This app serves as an exercise in asynchronous Dart programming and making http get requests to online weather APIs using geolocation data. It allows the user to get the weather for their current location, along with getting the current weather for any city that they request. It uses the OpenWeatherMap APIs to accomplish this.
